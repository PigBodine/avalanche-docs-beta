# Avalanche Docs

## Overview
This repo contains the contents for our docs deployed [here](https://docs-beta.avax.network).

The website is built using [Docusaurus 2](https://docusaurus.io/).

## Contributing

Contributing to the docs site is a great way to get involved with the Avalanche dev community! Here's some things you need to know to get started.
### Contents
* All the docs are located in the [docs](docs) directory.
* The left side-bar of the page is controlled by [sidebars.js](sidebars.js).
* Extensive docs for Docusaurus can be found [here](https://docusaurus.io/docs).

### Installation

```
$ yarn
```

### Local Development

```
$ yarn start
```

This command starts a local development server and opens up a browser window. Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.

### Build

```
$ yarn build
```

This command generates static content into the `build` directory and can be served using any static contents hosting service.
